## Machine Learning
[Biological Data Classification via Faster MAXimum Feasible Subsystem Algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9478696)

- In this work, I have developed a novel algorithm tailored for binary data classification. This algorithm presents an inventive approach for delineating between different classes, such as discerning ill patients from a normal population in medical diagnosis. Rigorous testing conducted on the UCI database, coupled with comparisons against four prevalent classification models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression) using 10-fold cross-validation, consistently reveals the algorithm's superior accuracy and promising performance in recall-oriented tasks. 

  
## Sparse Recovery:
[Recovery of Noisy Compressively Sensed Speech via Regularized Maximum Feasible Subsystem Algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9459978)

- In this paper, I developed an optimization algorithm (Method B) for the recovery of noisy compressively sensed speech. The algorithm operates by iteratively identifying a support set of variables crucial for reconstructing the speech signal from compressed measurements. It begins by solving a Linear Programming (LP) problem to select candidate variables with the largest magnitude. Through an iterative process of updating objective function coefficients and selecting the winning variable, Method B efficiently identifies a small set of variables forming the support for the system of equations. To enhance robustness in the presence of noise, I further proposed a regularized version of Method B, which incorporates an absolute error tolerance into the LP constraints. This regularization ensures greater resilience to noise during the recovery process, improving the algorithm's performance in real-world scenarios.
